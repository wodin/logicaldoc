NOTEs & questions: 

1) Document UPDATE: 
   If an update transaction (document) ends successfully don't get a message back?
     (Now don't get anything) 
    
2) Folder UPDATE: If an update transaction (folder) ends successfully don't get a message back?
     (Now don't get anything) 
    
3) Folder DELETE: if I try to delete a folder that does not exist, the Web-Service should return an error message? 
       (Now always returns "ok", even if the folder to be deleted does not exist)
       (i'm thinking that it should return something like this: "warning: the folder does not exist")
