          <p>Under some circumstances, it may prove to be useful allowing a number of documents contained in an specific
           folder organization to be inserted into the system on the fly, at once.<br>
           In LogicalDOC this functionality is available by importing from a ".ZIP" archive.<br>
           Thanks to this function, it is possible to replicate into the system the exact structure of "the zipped folder",
            either by the names and the nesting of folders or by the names and positioning of documents it contains.  <br> 
            <br>
            It is necessary to keep in mind that there are, however, some limitations, the main of which is that
            the .ZIP archive to be uploaded must not be excessively large.<br>
            It is advised not to exceed the size 20 MB (megabytes).  <br> 
            <br>
            First of all, the customer must create the folder with needed documents on his/her own PC.  <br>
            Next, the customer must produce an ".ZIP" file of that folder, using a tool like WinZip, 7-Zip or similar.<br>
            Finally, created ".ZIP" file must be uploaded into LogicalDOC.  </p>
             <h3>Upload ".ZIP" file  </h3> 
          <p>          </p><ol>
            <li> In the Documents area, select the "father" folder that will accommodate the documents contained in the
             archive.<br>
             The current path is shown on the right side of the screen.</li> 
            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
              <div align="center"><img src="images/importzip01.gif" height="240" width="496"></div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <li>Clicking on the "Bulk Import" icon, it will appear a mask for the uploading of files similar to the one
            used for the insertion of a new document.  </li> 
            <li>Press the "Examine" key and select on the local hard disk the ".ZIP" archive.</li> 
            <li>Press the "Upload" key in order to transfer the file into LogicalDOC.<br>
             The progress bar indicates the advance of the uploading operation (file transfer).<br>
             At the end, as the bar reaches 100%, it will appear the push-button "Bulk import (zip)" next to the lower right of
              the insertion mask.</li> 
            <li>Press the push-button "Bulk import (zip)", in order to start the import.  <br> 
              <br>
              <br>
              <div>
                <div align="center"><img src="images/importzip02.jpg" height="237" width="750"></div>
              </div>
          </li></ol>
          <br>
          The status pointer <img src="images/importzip03.gif" height="23" width="23"> (up to the right) starts to flash
           signaling that an operation has been started.<br>
          After a while (that may be even of some minutes) becomes shown the contained folder with its new content.<br> 
          <br>
          <strong>Once started the operation, the customer must not abort it till be over.</strong>
           Since this could be of long duration, the session could be interrupted; in this case you do not have to worry,
           the system however, will proceed with the import; it will only be necessary to login again.  <br> 
          <br>
          LogicalDOC will adopt the structure of the "zipped" folder and will copy all documents in the archive.  <br>
          The new folder an all its documents will inherit all the permissions from the folder inside which they are imported.
