LogicalDOC is a Web-based Document Management System (DMS) based on open 
source technology (JSF +Spring +Hibernate). Thanks to its intuitive interface, 
LogicalDOC transforms complex operations into easy tasks. It allows the 
storage, organization, versioning and use of all kind of files and documents 
within an user friendly interface.

Version 5.2.1 mainly fixes some problems related to localization of the GUI 
and indexing of documents using languages not supported by Lucene Snowball 
APIs. It also contains improvements for performance with regard to the 
creation of menu and retrieval of documents lists.

Among other things, the software has been adapted for support the Oracle 
database 10g
