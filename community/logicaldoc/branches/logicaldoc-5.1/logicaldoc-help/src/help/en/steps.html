			   <p>LogicalDOC is a simple-to-use web application. Its online
                guide allows you to become familiar with the main functions of the program in a
                very short time. This chapter, however, tends to give a brief introduction from
                the entry into the system until the end of a generic work session.              </p>
              <h3>Login</h3>
              <p>In order to log into the system you must know your login details: username and password. Once you posses this information, you can access the page to enter the application by pointing your browser to the address configured during the program set-up, for example http://localhost:8080.</p> 
			  <center>
              <img src="images/fs_01.gif" width="333" height="195">
			  <br>
			  Picture 1: Login Form<br>
			  </center>
			  		<br>
			                The form asks for username and password, and an optional language other than the one provided for the user. Simply enter the required information and proceed by pressing the Login button.<br>
			                If the authentication is successful then you will be taken to the main page; if the login fails you will see an error message and you will be directed to the same form.
			                <h3>Home Page </h3>
              <p>
			             <center>
			                 <img src="images/fs_02.gif" width="631" height="226" heigth="197">
							 <br>
							 Picture 2: Main Page
                </center>
			              <br>
			              In the home page there are some controls placed in drop-down boxes:<br>
			              welcome message, notification of messages from other users (messaging features will be described below), the list of recent documents accessed, the documents downloaded, the tag cloud (which contains the most used tags into the archive).<br>
			              At the top of the page the navigation menu is placed which lets you access the main areas of the program. You will find the document search-box above the menu.</p>
			  <h3>Program exit</h3>
			  <p>Once the working session is ended, you must click on the Logout link at the right- top area of the page. By pressing on this link, many resources allocated to the current session are released and made available to other 
			    users. If you simply close the browser, the session remains open until the end of the timeout, which uses system resources unnecessarily.</p>
