This new release of LogicalDOC 5.1 introduces some important and interesting 
changes.

The most important of these is the ability to define schortcut on documents. 
This feature enables the administrator to allows a user, that doesn't have the 
permissions to consult and/or edit a document, to visualize and modify however 
the document infos through them shortcut inserted into a folder accessible by 
the user.

The second notable feature is certainly the ability to move a folder and all 
its contents to another folder. This feature is now available also in the 
WebDAV interface.

Another change is the introduction of the contextual menu on folders and the 
improved visualization of complex folders. The contextual menu provides access 
from a single point to all the administrative functions on folders, that 
allows a user interface cleaner and more efficient.

In addition to these features has been enhanced the support for Mac OS X 
(Safari), particularly on deleting folders, content layout and documents 
preview.
