This new release of LogicalDoc 4.6 introduces a number of important changes.

Arguably the most important of all is the ability to specify the type for the 
custom attributes for a document Template. In fact, this change involves a 
major change on the database.

Also been profoundly changed the web-services, with the introduction of new 
methods to simplify the integration with LogicalDOC.

Another update worth mentioning is reached on the WebDAV plugin in order to 
allow editing of a document while maintaining the versioning. It must be said 
that this behavior is largely related to the client used. To make the best 
from the WebDAV you need a client that supports correctly the update method 
such as WebDrive.

As for the Enterprise version a specific module for Active Directory was 
created from to simplify the configuration, we have improved the plugin for 
acquisition by mailbox with IMAP and SSL support.
Also the parametric search has been retouched to allow more efficient and 
modular searches.

Finally, many thanks to the group of translators for the French language: 
Manuel Le Boette, Maxime Leboeuf and Fran√ßois Blondel for contributing to the 
translation making LogicalDOC more usable in all French speaking countries.
