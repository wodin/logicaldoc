			      Picture 3: Documents and folders 
             			    </center></p>
              <p>Click on <span class="style1">Documents</span>, the fourth item in the navigation menu. The central part of the 
                page is now occupied by the documents, which are organized into folders and subfolders 
                (similar organization in a normal disk of your PC).<br>
                Folder navigation is simply done by clicking on the name of the folder in 
                the list of folders on the left side. Now click on the folder Documents and then 
                on the icon <a href="images/icons01folder.gif" target="_blank"><span class="iconref">1.1</span></a></span> (placed on top of the panel containing the list of folders). 
                Enter &quot;test&quot; as the name of the folder and press the <span class="style1">Save</span> button. A message will 
              warn you that a new folder has been created.</p>
              <p>
			               			    <center>
			                              <img src="images/documentmanagement_02.gif" width="527" height="173" heigth="197">

			      Picture 4: Folder creation 
			               			    </center></p>
										<p>You should now see that the new folder has been created. Click on its name in order 
										  to enter it. Note that at the top of the main area a so-called &lsquo;breadcrumb&rsquo; keeps track 
										  of the route of the folder.<br>
										  Now insert a new document by clicking on the icon <a href="images/icons02document.gif" target="_blank" class="iconref style2"><span class="iconref">2.1</span></a>.<br>
										  Initially, you are asked for the file to upload and the language in which the document has been written in.<br>
										  To upload a file, simply press the <span class="style1">Browse...</span> button then select a file from your PC and press the <span class="style1">Upload</span> button. A progress bar will display the status of the<br>
										  upload process.<br>
										  The language specification is done through the drop-down list and 
										  it is important since it affects the indexing engine of the documents content.<br>
										  In addition to that, there are two checkboxes available: if the first is checked,
										  LogicalDOC retrieves immediately the tags of the document; if the second is
									    checked, LogicalDOC does the immediate indexing of the document.</p>

			      Picture 5: Document's editing form 
			               			    </center></p>
										<p>Once the document has been uploaded, you can proceed to the next step by selecting the button Next &gt;&gt;&gt;. Some information are extracted, and a form for document editing is displayed for final assessment. At this stage you can change various parameters of the document, but only if you have the editing 
										  permission. The most important parameter is the one containing the 
										  tags(they must be separated by comma), as these can be used later for 
									    searching. The user can classify a document with a number of tags. <br>
										By clicking on <span class="style1">Save</span>, the document will be stored and indexed.		<br>								 
										Right after the upload, you will be directed to the same folder in which the newly uploaded document is located. You can then download the document by clicking on<br>
										  it.<br>
										  LogicalDOC will not allow two documents with the same name inside the same 
										  folder; for example, if you try to insert a document named &quot;doc&quot; in the &quot;test&quot; folder,<br>
										  and there already exists a document named &ldquo;doc&rdquo;, the new document will be 
										  automatically renamed to &quot;doc(1)&quot;.										</p>

										<p><span class="style1">By right-clicking on the document</span>, a contextual menu will appear.
										  It provides access to major management functions on the single document such as										  &lsquo;checkout&rsquo; or &lsquo;edit&rsquo;.<br>
