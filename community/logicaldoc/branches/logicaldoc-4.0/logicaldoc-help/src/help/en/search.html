          <p>In LogicalDOC you can search a document in four different ways:<br>
            1. Quick search<br>
            2. <a href="#advanced">Advanced search</a><br>
            3. <a href="#parametric">Parametric search</a> (Enterprise Edition only)</p>
           <h3>Simple search  </h3> 
          <br>
          The simple search mask is always present and accessible any time in the upper part of the window.<br>
          It is important to specify the language in which the desired search has to be executed.
          As a start, the system proposes the default Document language for the customer (in English).  By pressing on icon <a href="images/icons03menu.gif" target="_blank"><span class="iconref">3.2</span></a> system will search for the entered word.<br>
          Simple search will find only documents archived in the base language (and not documents in other languages).<br>
          If you want to search on documents written in any language, it is necessary to select the option "All documents".<br> 
          <br>

          <div>
            <div align="center"><img src="images/simplesearch.jpg" height="59" width="382"><br>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div align="center">
            <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
              <tbody><tr>
                <td class="noteHeader" height="25" width="180"><img src="images/note_ico.gif" height="10" hspace="4" width="10">Note:</td> 
                <td height="25">Â </td> 
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td colspan="2" class="noteBody">Searching for documents using only one language is fastest than
                 the same search carried out on All documents.</td> 
              </tr>
            </tbody></table>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          Of every found element you can see the title, an extract of the containing text with the found words,
          the dimension in KBytes, a score and a link for: 
          
          <ul> 
            <li>Download the document (title of the document)  <br> 
            </li>
            <li>Select the document in  folder (Show path -&gt; click on the link path) </li> 
            <li>Show similar documents</li> 
            <li>Use the Document's Tools menu (Right Click on the title of the document) </li>
          </ul>
          <p>          The result presentation is shown in the form of a list ordered by the score reached.<br>
          The score is calculated on the frequency of the tried terms (or words with common root) of the text of the files.  <br> 
          <br>
          <br>
          </p>
          <div>
            <div align="center"><img src="images/searchresults.gif" height="390" width="879"></div>
          </div>
          <p>In case of multiple results, the system will produce more pages than shown. The rest can be
           consulted pressing the cursor keys on the lower screen side to right of the results page.  <br> 
            <br>
            <strong>Search on more words.</strong><br>
            It is possible to search at the same time on more terms. Specifying, as an example, "future remote control" in
            the search field, there will become found, not only all documents that have the words indicated in the text, but
            also the documents that contain 2 of the 3 words or a single one of the 3 words.<br>
            We will see, besides, the documents that contain the words derived from "control": control, controlled,
             controller, those derived from "remote": remotelly and those which have future as root.  <br> 
            <br>
            <strong>Use logical operators</strong> <br>
            In the simple search form it is already possible to use operators.<br>
            Using characters like "<strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong>" it is possible to execute searches on obliged
            terms and using exclusion. As an example, composing the phrase "contracted +future -plan", the system will search
            all the documents that have the "future" word compulsorily and that compulsorily they do not contain the word
            "plan", while the "contracted" term comes inserted as optional.<br>
            A simple search for "contracted activity" instead, will find all the documents in which one of the 2 terms appears
            at least.<br>
            A search like "activity -contracted", will produce all the documents that contain the word "activity"
            and, at the same time, do not contain the "contracted" word.  <br>
            Searching <strong>"+red +mario"</strong> is equivalent to <strong>red AND mario "</strong>. That means that we
            will try all the documents in which the bothd words red and mario appear.<br>
            It is also possible to explain these searches, as an example, "future AND project NOT development" is
            equivalent to "+future +project -development".<br>
            When there are used logical operators like AND, OR, NOT, it is necessary to keep in mind that they must be
            written compulsorily in upper case.  </p>
             <h3><a name="advanced" />Advanced search</h3> 
          <br>
          The mask for advanced search is accessible pressing the link <span class="style5">Advanced Search</span>, present to the right side of the
          simple search form in the uppper side of the window. The difference regarding the simple search is that such mask lets you specify, in a simple way, complex and active
          search criteria.  Moreover, you can view the advanced search
page under <span class="style5">Searches</span> menu. <br> 
          <br>
          <br>
          <div>
            <div align="center"><img src="images/searchadvanced00.jpg" height="56" width="360"></div>
          </div>
          <br>
          This feature allows the user to search for one or more words
through different search criteria. The search is performed on the contents
and metadata of indexed documents and only on the search fields
selected in checkbox. In addition, you can restrict your search only to a
folder and, eventually, to its subfolders; you can search also among the
attributes of a specific template (document type) associated with the searched
document. <br>
          Using the advance search, it is possible to try simple words or phrases. Some words can moreover be excluded
          from the search or to activate an approximate search.<br> 
          The result can be narrowed based on the dimension, the date and the format of documents.<br> 
          <br>
          Among the important aspects of such search:<br> 
          <ul>
            <li>the advance possibility of searching for terms that concur to express complex filters<br> 
            </li>
            <li>searching for documents dimension</li> 
            <li>searching for document data (entered using the insertion/modification mask of the document)</li> 
            <li>searching for publication date (last modification of the document)</li> 
          </ul>
          <br>
          The result of this procedure of advanced search shows the same form as the one for simple searchs and the
          documents are accessible in the same ways.

          <h3><a name="parametric" id="parametric"></a>Parametric search  (Enterprise Edition only)</h3>
            <p>In LogicalDOC, under <span class="style5">Searches</span> menu you can view the parametric
search page. This feature allows the user to search for documents that
contain specific values on their metadata. The search is performed only on
the metadata of the document and unlike the advanced search, all
documents are taken into consideration, including those not already
indexed. In particular, you can use the special character "%" to perform
more sophisticated searches; for example, if you want to search for
documents that have a custom ID with the string "invoice" at the
beginning, then simply type "invoice%" into the "Custom ID" search field. If
the searched string is contained in the custom ID, simply type "%invoice%"
into the "Custom ID" search field.</p>
