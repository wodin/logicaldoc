     * Returns a reader for the text content of the given binary document.
     * The content type and character encoding (if available and applicable)
     * are given as arguments. The given content type is guaranteed to be
     * one of the types reported by {@link #getContentTypes()} unless the
     * implementation explicitly permits other content types.
     * <p>
     * The implementation can choose either to read and parse the given
     * document immediately or to return a reader that does it incrementally.
     * The only constraint is that the implementation must close the given
     * stream latest when the returned reader is closed. The caller on the
     * other hand is responsible for closing the returned reader.
     * <p>
     * The implemenation should only throw an exception on transient
     * errors, i.e. when it can expect to be able to successfully extract
     * the text content of the same binary at another time. An effort
     * should be made to recover from syntax errors and other similar problems.
     * <p>
     * This method should be thread-safe, i.e. it is possible that this
     * method is invoked simultaneously by different threads to extract the
     * text content of different documents. On the other hand the returned
     * reader does not need to be thread-safe.
     *
     * @param stream   binary document from which to extract text
     * @param type     MIME type of the given document, lower case
     * @param encoding the character encoding of the binary data,
     *                 or <code>null</code> if not available
     * @return reader for the extracted text content
     * @throws IOException on transient errors
