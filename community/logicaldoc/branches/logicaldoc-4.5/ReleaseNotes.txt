
LogicalDOC is a Web-based Document Management System (DMS), easy to use and learn. 

The most significant change is undoubtedly the introduction of the external 
authentication system. This means that you can connect LogicalDOC to an 
external LDAP or Active Directory server.

The discussion on documents has been improved, now there is a genuine forum 
for debate on the single document that allows you to insert comments and start 
dynamic discussions.

Improved the versioning with metadata diffs among versions.

Security controls have been increased with the minimum password length and the 
rules for password expiration.

The file system structure of the document repository was revised. 
Improved support for localization, for example, we can support the variations 
of language such as Portuguese Brazilian. 

LogicalDOC uses the following core technologies:

 * Hibernate
 * Spring
 * Lucene 2.4
 * CXF (JAX-WS webservices)
 * ICEfaces (Ajax JSF framework)
 * JPF (Java plugin framework)
