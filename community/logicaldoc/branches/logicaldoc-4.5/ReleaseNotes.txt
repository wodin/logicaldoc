
The purpose of this 4.5.1 release is to improve the multilingual support 
provided by LogicalDOC.

In particular, after the creation of plugins to support Greek and Chinese 
languages, there was the need to treat properly the files with ideographic 
characters.

Not only that, it was necessary to make some changes to properly index the 
content of foreign documents and display correctly the snippets with search 
results.

Among other things the search by tag has been improved, allowing to manually 
enter the first character of the tag, useful for non-Latin alphabets.

A big thanks to Marinos Vlasakis for Greek translation and Tong Hongxian 
(Shanghai Electric) for translation in Chinese simplified.
