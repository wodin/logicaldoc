              <p>In LogicalDOC there are processes which are performed during normal  execution of the program without the intervention of user. These processes are scheduled tasks since you can schedule their execution.<br>
                The section <span class="style5">Tasks</span> allows you to schedule the execution of these
              processes.</p>

              <p>Special configurable characters take the following meanings. The  character '?' is allowed on the day of the month and day of the week.  It is used to define any specific day. <br>
                <br>
The character '*' is used to specify all the values. For example '*' in the minutes indicates "every minute". <br>
<br>
The character ',' is used to specify additional values. For example  2,4,6 on the day of the week indicates "the day Monday, Wednesday and  Friday." <br>
<br>
The character '/' is used to specify increments. For  example'0/15' in the second indicates "the second 0, 15, 30 and 45"  and "5/15" in the same field shows "the second 5, 20, 35 and 50". <br>
<br>
The 'L' is allowed for the day of the month and day of the week. This  character has a different meaning for the two fields. On the day of the  month indicates the last day of the month (January 31, February 28  ...). <br>
When used in the days of the week, indicates the last day of the month xx such as "6L" means "the last Friday of the month." <br>
<br>
The 'W' is allowed for the day of the week. It is used to specify the  working day(Monday, Friday) closer to the specified day. For example, if you specify "15W" as a day of the month  means "the working day closest to 15 of the month." So if 15 is  Saturday, will be 
took Friday 15. If the 15 is Sunday, then will be Monday 16. If the 15 is on Tuesday, will be 15 on Tuesday. <br>
<br>
The characters' L 'and' W 'may be combined in the days of the month and indicate the last working day of the month. <br>
<br>
The character '#' is allowed for the day of the week. This character is  used to specify the "#th day of the month." For example, the value "6#3" indicates the 3 rd Friday of the month. <br>
<br>
In addition to  the descriptive parameters of planning, you can set the specific  maximum duration of processing. If this is specified, the procedure will be automatically stopped after the configured time.              </p>
              <h3>Progress status  and log</h3>
              <p>If a task is running you can see it in column <span class="style5">Execution</span> and  the progression bar will be updated  constantly showing the percentage of progress. 
                At the side of this bar  an animated icon indicates that the process is running. <br> 
This icon is clickable and allows you to stop the execution. <br>
When the task is not running, the same icon appears motionless and and by
clicking on it you can start the execution. <br>
Each task has also a related log file that can be inspected by clicking on the link <span class="style5">Log</span>. 
 This log details how the activity proceeds. <br>
