'''LogicalDOC''' is an [[free software|Free/Libre]] [[document management system]] that is designed to handle and share documents within an organization.  

LogicalDOC is a content repository, with [[Lucene]] indexing, [[jBPM]] workflow, and a set of automatic import procedures.
The system was developed using [[Java platform|Java]] technology.

== History ==
In 2006 two developers with experience in commercial [[J2EE]] products decided to start a business called Logical Objects, with the mission to maintain and evolve the Open Source project Contineo.<ref>[http://contineo.sourceforge.net The old project Contineo]</ref>  After one year, Logical Objects decided to branch the old project and to start a completely new product called LogicalDOC.

In mid-2008, the first release of LogicalDOC was made available at SourceForge.<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/projects/logicaldoc SourceForge]</ref>  The first release was numbered 3.6<ref>[http://www.theserverside.com/discussions/thread.tss?thread_id=51275 LogicalDOC - Document Management, DMS version 3.6 released]</ref> in order to continue the numeration from the old project.

In the 2010 LogicalDOC won the [[Infoworld Bossie Awards|Bossie Awards]]<ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source/bossie-awards-2010-the-best-open-source-applications-150&current=8&last=1#slideshowTop Bossie 2010 winner: LogicalDOC]</ref> in the category of [[Document Management]].

== Usage ==
LogicalDOC is a web-based document management application, so a web browser is needed to use it. Current web browsers that have been tested for compatibility with Logical Doc include: [[Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Safari]], [[Google Chrome]].  The web interface is built using [[Google Web Toolkit]].

== Architecture ==
LogicalDOC is developed using Java technology based on [[J2SE]] standards and the Tomcat application server. Therefore it can be installed and executed on various platforms ([[GNU/Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]])

The LogicalDOC architecture is based on the following technologies:

* [[Apache Tomcat|Apache_Tomcat]] Application Server
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] J2SE (JDK 1.6 or higher)
* [[Google Web Toolkit|GWT]] (Google Web Toolkit - Ajax)
* [[Lucene]]
* [[Spring Framework]]

Due to its lightweight architecture, LogicalDOC can work on a wide set of devices and can be used to implement Cloud/SaaS document management.

Data can be stored in a RDBMS ([[MySQL]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[PostgreSQL]], etc.)

== General features ==
A [[document management]] system manages personal documents or business documentation, making it easier to find a previous document version. It enables searching by content, using document content indexing. LogicalDOC has currently been localized in 15 languages.  LogicalDOC can be set up to support distinct full-text indexes for each supported language in order to apply specific indexing algorithms tailored to a particular language or variant.
