	 * responsible for closing the returned reader.

	 * i.e. when it can expect to be able to successfully extract the text
	 * content of the same binary at another time. An effort should be made to
	 * recover from syntax errors and other similar problems.

	 * This method should be thread-safe, i.e. it is possible that this method
	 * is invoked simultaneously by different threads to extract the text
	 * content of different documents. On the other hand the returned reader
	 * does not need to be thread-safe.
