
LogicalDOC is a Web-based Document Management System (DMS), easy to use and learn. 

This 4.0 release is a heavily refactored version of LogicalDOC.

The database has been completely rewritten, security management has been rewritten 
from scratch and the system was tested with 1M (1,000,000) of real documents.

It was also introduced support for WebDAV (thanks to Sebastian Wenzky) and the 
creation of custom attributes on documents via document's template.

The WebDAV is accessibile at the following address:
http://localhost:8080/logicaldoc/webdav/store/    
user/pass: admin/admin

Among other things the deferred indexing of documents has been implemented 
along with the scheduled task for calculation of Tag-Cloud.

LogicalDOC uses the following core technologies:

 * J2EE 2.4 web tier
 * JSF 1.2
 * JAX-WS
 * Lucene 2.4
 * Hibernate
 * Spring
 * CXF
 * ICEfaces
 * JPF
